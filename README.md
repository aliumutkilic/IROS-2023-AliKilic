# IROS-2023-AliKilic

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper titled **"A Novel Approximation for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum Model of Locomotion"** published in IEEE IROS 2023 Conference. You can access it [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10341418).

Our paper proposes a new reduced-order model for complex walking robots, and a subsequent analytical stepping and stiffness controller. 

## Repository Structure
